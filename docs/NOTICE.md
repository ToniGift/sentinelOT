## MITRE ATT&CK(R) for ICS

The file `data/ics-attack.json` is a copy of MITRE's ATT&CK for ICS data in
STIX format. It was downloaded on 6 October 2026 (ATT&CK version 19.2) from
MITRE's public `attack-stix-data` repository on GitHub. SentinelOT reads this
file to check technique IDs and names and to give its ATT&CK mapper agent the
list of techniques to choose from.
